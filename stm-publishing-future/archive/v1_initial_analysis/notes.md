## Key Findings from Research

### 1. STM Publishing Market Overview (2024-2025)

**Market Size:**
- Global scientific/technical publishing: $12.65B in 2022 (+2.7% YoY)
- Total professional publishing forecast: $88.4B by 2026
- Online content segment: ~30% of market, growing ~7% annually

**Critical Trends:**
- Books declining; journals facing upheaval from open access policies
- Traditional subscription models threatened by OA pressure
- STM online services representing growth opportunity

### 2. Research Volume Explosion vs. Engagement Crisis

**Volume Growth (Exponential):**
- Total articles indexed in Scopus/Web of Science: 3.3M in 2022
- Growth rate: +5.6% per year (2016-2022)
- 2022 volume was 47% higher than 2016
- Preprints doubling every 5.6 years (fastest growth)
- Traditional publications doubling every 9.8 years
- Scopus coverage: 28,000 active journals + 300,000 books (2024)

**Preprint Explosion:**
- bioRxiv: 43,629 preprints in 2024 (above pandemic peak)
- medRxiv: 12,863 preprints in 2024
- Moved to openRxiv nonprofit (March 2025)
- 2/3 of bioRxiv preprints later published in peer-reviewed journals

**The Strain on Scientists:**
- Publication workload per scientist increased dramatically
- Growth in articles outpaced growth in number of scientists
- Value per citable article declined despite rising subscription fees
- Scientists overwhelmed by volume
- Attention span declining: from 2.5 min to 47 seconds (general research)

### 3. Open Access Revolution & Business Model Disruption

**Plan S Impact:**
- Ended support for transformative arrangements Dec 2024
- Mixed results: ~50% of new literature now OA in some form
- Transformative agreements surpassed 1,000 (ESAC Registry)
- Ironically strengthened market share of largest publishers

**Diamond OA Emergence:**
- 29,000 diamond OA journals (no fees for authors or readers)
- Major 2024-2025 funding initiatives:
  - Dutch NWO: grants up to €50K for journal transitions
  - German BMBF: multiple projects funded
  - Gates Foundation: preprint-centric policy, stopping APCs
- Toluca-Cape Town Declaration 2024: "scholarly knowledge is a public good"
- Challenge: Most grants last only a few years; sustainability gap remains

**US Policy:**
- White House requires immediate public access to all US-funded research by 2025

### 4. AI Transformation of Research Consumption

**AI Tools Dominating:**
- ChatGPT leads with 3x usage vs nearest competitor (Gemini)
- Survey of 1,800+ researchers (April 2025): widespread adoption
- Primary uses: summarization, literature search, coding, translation

**Impact on Reading Behavior:**
- AI scanning/filtering hundreds of papers in minutes
- Summarization becoming starting point vs. full reading
- Concern: drift away from deep, critical inquiry
- Known issue: ChatGPT hallucinates citations but still widely used

**Specialized Tools Emerging (2025):**
- RDiscovery: AI-assisted reading with summarization
- Elicit: targeted question answering across papers
- Otio, Avidnote, others: specialized research assistants

### 5. File Format Evolution: From Static to Executable

**Jupyter Book 2.0 (2025):**
- Official Jupyter Subproject
- Executable figures & notebooks powered by JupyterHub/Binder
- Readers can run computations directly from published documents
- Web-first, interactive 3D visualizations

**SciPy Proceedings Transformation (2024):**
- Adopted MyST Markdown + Curvenote
- Web-first articles with deep-dive links
- Interactive visualizations
- Rich rendering of Jupyter Notebooks

**Broader Executable Papers Movement:**
- Notebooks Now! (American Geophysical Union)
- Microscopy Society of America: interactive publishing + large-scale data
- Arcadia Science: automated Jupyter → publishable documents workflow
- Enabled by: MyST Markdown, JupyterLab, BinderHub, Curvenote

**Interactive Publication Benefits:**
- Self-contained, multimedia-rich
- Readers can check underlying data
- Document becomes research tool, not just communication
- Formats: text, video, audio, bitmap, spreadsheets, animations

### 6. Alternative Dissemination Channels

**Social Media Shifts:**
- ResearchGate, Academia.edu changing research sharing
- Facebook & YouTube leading platforms for dissemination (2024)
- Journals with Twitter accounts: +46% tweets, +34% citations
- Twitter/X exodus after 2022: institutions migrating to Mastodon, Threads
- Instagram & LinkedIn increasingly key for 2024

**Nanopublications & Structured Data:**
- Small knowledge graph snippets, machine-interpretable
- >10M nanopublications in Life Sciences
- RDF graphs with assertion + provenance + metadata
- Cryptographically verifiable
- Atomic-level citations/attribution
- Drives data accessibility & interoperability

### 7. Measurement & Metrics Evolution

**Beyond Citations:**
- Traditional metrics losing relevance
- Altmetrics: social media mentions, blog posts, news articles
- Shift to open databases: Lens, OpenAlex
- More nuanced impact assessments needed

## Emerging Patterns & Hypotheses

1. **The Deluge Paradox**: More papers published than ever, but less read per paper
2. **Consumption Fragmentation**: From "read full paper" → "AI summary" → "nanopublication citation"
3. **Format Bifurcation**: Static PDFs for archival vs. executable notebooks for reproducibility
4. **Discovery Crisis**: Traditional browsing obsolete; AI-mediated discovery rising
5. **Business Model Transition**: Subscription → APC → Diamond/preprint-centric
6. **Quality vs. Quantity**: Exponential growth straining peer review system
7. **Platform Instability**: Social media channels for research dissemination unstable

### Key Insights Generated

**The Deluge Paradox**: Core finding that research output growth (5.6% annually) massively outpaces scientist attention capacity, creating fundamental mismatch.

**Three Transformations**:
1. **Consumption**: From full reading → AI summarization → nanopublication citations
2. **Format**: From static PDF → executable notebooks → interactive research tools
3. **Business**: From subscription → APC → diamond/preprint-first models

**Strategic Recommendations**:
- Invest in AI discovery infrastructure
- Adopt executable notebook formats
- Experiment with diamond OA sustainability models
- Build overlay peer review services
- Develop nanopublication systems
- Collaborate on open standards
