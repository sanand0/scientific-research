# The Resilient Incumbents: Why STM Publishing Won't Transform As Fast As You Think

**A critical analysis separating hype from reality in scientific publishing (2025-2035)**

---

## Executive Summary

The narrative around scientific publishing goes like this: **exponential paper growth, AI disruption, open access mandates, executable notebooks—revolution is imminent**.

After deep investigation, here's what the data actually shows:

**1. Publishers Are Thriving, Not Dying**: Elsevier posts 37% profit margins, Springer Nature 28%. They charge $3,000-$5,000 per article when real costs are $200-$1,000. These aren't companies on the brink—they're extracting sustainable rents from a system that rewards them.

**2. Open Access Is Evolving, Not Revolting**: Despite mandates, only 46% of 2023 papers were OA. Compliance with funder mandates varies from 27-91% and has "plateaued." Diamond OA—the supposed alternative—is failing: 75% cite financial constraints, 71% have no budget, and 23 German journals closed recently.

**3. Researchers Still Chase Prestige**: Nature/Science publications account for 20% of university rankings. Tenure committees still count impact factors. The incentive structure hasn't changed—and won't change from publishers alone.

**Realistic Timeline**: Gradual evolution over 10-15 years (not 3-5), with incumbent adaptation more likely than disruption. Think print→digital (successful publisher evolution) rather than Blockbuster→Netflix (disruption).

**For Publishers**: Invest in AI tools, adopt formats when demand materializes, use high margins to acquire threats. Your moat is prestige + network effects + institutional inertia, not technology.

## Part I: Debunking the Hype—What's NOT Happening

### Myth #1: "Executable Notebooks Are Replacing PDFs"

**The Hype**: Jupyter Book 2.0, SciPy Proceedings, AGU's "Notebooks Now!"—executable papers are the future!

**The Reality**:
- Of 91 papers examined that mentioned Jupyter notebooks, only 37 (40%) provided accessible notebooks
- Journal of Open Source Software: 431 papers total related to Jupyter
- GitHub has 1.5M repos with notebooks—sounds big until you realize 3.3M papers are published annually
- **Adoption in actual publishing: <1%**

**Why**: Researchers are evaluated on traditional journals. Executable notebooks require new skills, tooling, and review processes. The infrastructure exists, but incentives don't.

**Realistic Timeline**: 10-15 years to 10% adoption in computational fields. Longer for experimental sciences.

### Myth #2: "Diamond OA Will Replace Subscriptions"

**The Hype**: 29,000 diamond OA journals! Gates Foundation stopped paying APCs! The future is free!

**The Reality**:
- **75%** of African diamond OA journals cite financial constraints as biggest challenge
- **71.4%** operate without approved annual budget
- **40%** describe funding as unstable
- **23** German diamond OA journals **closed** (not just Global South problem)
- **60%** rely on volunteers (doesn't scale)
- **25%** report financial losses

**Why**: Short-term grants ≠ sustainable funding. Consortium models just shift costs to universities. No one has proven sustainability at scale for high-quality, professionally-edited journals.

**What's Happening**: Diamond OA works for small, niche journals run by societies. It's struggling everywhere else.

### Myth #3: "Plan S and Mandates Are Forcing Change"

**The Hype**: Coalition S ended transformative deals in 2024! US mandates immediate OA! Revolution is here!

**The Reality**:
- Compliance varies 27-91% across funders (average 67%)
- Voluntary OA policies: **5% compliance**
- 46.2% of 2023 papers had "some form" of OA (including green OA, embargoes)
- Compliance has **"plateaued in recent years"**
- Transformative agreements reached 1,000—and **strengthened big publishers**

**Why**: Policy announcements ≠ implementation. Enforcement is weak. Publishers adapt (hybrid models, higher APCs, bundled deals). Researchers prioritize prestige over compliance.

### Myth #4: "AI Is Killing Deep Reading"

**The Hype**: ChatGPT dominates (3x nearest competitor)! Attention spans collapsed to 47 seconds! Nobody reads anymore!

**The Reality**:
- Gloria Mark's 47-second figure measures **screen-switching in workplaces**, not research paper reading
- No evidence scientists read fewer papers—they may read MORE by filtering better
- AI tools might enable consumption of more literature, not less
- **We don't actually know** if AI summarization hurts comprehension (unstudied)

**What's Actually Happening**: Researchers use AI for discovery and triage, then read what matters. This is adaptation, not crisis.

---

## Part II: What's ACTUALLY Happening—And Why It Matters

### 1. **Profitable Publishers Are Adapting, Not Dying**

**The Numbers**:
- Elsevier: 37% operating profit margin
- Springer Nature: 28% margin (€512M profit on €1.85B revenue in 2024)
- Actual cost per article: $200-$1,000
- What they charge: $3,000-$5,000
- **They make 3-5x their costs**

**Cost Breakdown (EMBO Press)**:
- 55% editorial/administrative labor
- 40% outsourced services and platforms
- 5% other

**What This Means**:
- High margins = resources to adapt
- Major cost is editorial infrastructure, not technology
- Disrupting publishers requires replacing editorial labor, not just hosting
- Platform costs are minimal; prestige + peer review are the products

**Strategic Responses We're Seeing**:
- Elsevier acquired Mendeley (reference management), SSRN (preprints)
- Publishers launching AI discovery tools (vertical integration)
- Hybrid models extracting revenue from both subscriptions AND APCs
- Bundled "transformative agreements" increasing market concentration

**Implication**: Incumbents with 30%+ margins can outspend upstarts, acquire threats, and adapt business models. They're not Blockbuster—they're Netflix (successfully transitioning).

### 2. **The Prestige Hierarchy Isn't Breaking—It's Entrenching**

**Why Researchers Still Target Nature/Science**:
- **20% of university rankings** (ARWU) based on Nature/Science papers
- Tenure/promotion tied to journal prestige and citation counts
- "Chaperoned" advantage: need existing Nature authors to break in
- Getting **harder** over time: new senior authors in Nature dropped from 39%→31% (1990-2012)

**Recent Survey Data (2024)**:
- Journal reputation + publication speed = top selection criteria for pressured researchers
- Quality and reputation remain highest-rated attributes
- NOT: open access, format, public accessibility

**Tenure/Promotion Reality**:
- Reform movement exists ("recognize public impact!")
- Implementation: **glacially slow**
- Citation counts and impact factors still dominate
- Even journals advocating reform use traditional metrics internally

**What This Means**:
- Network effects create winner-take-all dynamics
- Elite journals get best submissions → more citations → more prestige (virtuous cycle)
- Researchers have NO incentive to publish in diamond OA or preprint-first if it hurts careers
- Disruption requires changing university incentives, not just publishing technology

### 3. **Quality Control Is Collapsing Under Volume**

**This part of the "crisis" narrative is TRUE**:

**Retraction Explosion**:
- 10,000+ retractions in 2023 (though 8,000 from one publisher's paper mills)
- Retraction rate tripled in decade to 0.2%+
- European biomedical retractions 4x increase (2000-2020)

**Reproducibility Crisis**:
- 89% of cancer biology results couldn't be reproduced (Amgen study)
- Only 39% of 100 psychology studies replicated
- 70%+ of researchers report failure to reproduce others' work
- **400,000+** published articles show paper mill similarities

**Why It's Happening**:
- 3.3M papers published in 2022, growing 5.6% annually
- Peer review doesn't scale (same # of reviewers, more papers)
- Perverse incentives reward quantity over quality
- Paper mills exploiting system

**What Publishers Are Doing**:
- AI-assisted plagiarism detection
- Post-publication peer review experiments
- Outsourcing to commercial editing services
- ...but fundamentally struggling

**Implication**: Volume growth IS a real problem. But it strengthens incumbents (who have resources for quality control) vs. upstarts.

### 4. **Regional Divergence: The Chinese Ecosystem**

**What I Missed Initially**:
- CNKI: world's largest Chinese-language repository (1,300+ top journals)
- Chinese R&D: 2.6% GDP ($470B in 2024)
- 83% of Chinese-authored articles (2012-2021) in top 20 international publishers
- **BUT** China is actively de-coupling

**China's "SCI Supremacy" Reform**:
- Discouraging over-reliance on Western-indexed journals
- "China Science and Technology Journal Excellence Action Plan"
- Elevating domestic journals to global standards
- Chinese publishers investing abroad (Frontiers China, international offices)

**What This Means**:
- Global publishing ≠ Western publishing
- Parallel ecosystem developing with different dynamics
- Western projections may apply to <50% of market
- Language/geography matter more than technology

### 5. **The Gradual OA Shift—Not Revolution**

**What's Actually Happening**:
- 46% of 2023 papers had some OA form (up from ~30% in 2015)
- Linear growth, not exponential
- Mix of green (repository), gold (APC), bronze (free to read, no license)
- **At current rate**: 70% OA by 2035, not 2027

**Funder Mandates**:
- Compliance averages 67% (varies 27-91%)
- Enforcement is weak
- Researchers find workarounds (embargoes, green OA)
- Publishers adapted (hybrid journals, higher APCs)

**The Business Model Evolution**:
- Subscriptions declining but still majority revenue
- APCs rising to compensate (some >$11,000 now)
- Transformative agreements = temporary bridges
- Diamond OA struggling with sustainability
- **Likely outcome**: Mix of models persisting for decades

**Implication**: Evolution, not revolution. Publishers adapting pricing, not collapsing.

## Part III: The Real Mechanisms of Change (And Why They're Slow)

### What Doesn't Drive Change:
❌ Technology availability (Jupyter exists; adoption is <1%)
❌ Policy announcements (mandates ≠ compliance)
❌ Moral arguments ("knowledge is a public good")
❌ Upstart competitors (get acquired or stay niche)

### What Actually Drives Change:
✅ **Incentive alignment**: Universities changing tenure criteria
✅ **Network effects**: Prestige hierarchy shifts (slow)
✅ **Cost pressure**: Libraries canceling subscriptions
✅ **Generational turnover**: New researchers with different norms
✅ **Vertical integration**: Combining publishing + tools + data

### Why Change Is Slow:

**1. Institutional Inertia**
- Universities have used same promotion criteria for 50+ years
- Changing tenure policies requires faculty senate votes, department buy-in, dean approval
- Individual universities can't change alone (collective action problem)
- Timeline: 10-20 years for meaningful shift

**2. Network Effects**
- Best researchers → prestigious journals → more citations → more prestige
- Self-reinforcing cycle
- Breaking requires coordinated shift (hard to organize)
- Timeline: Generational (20-30 years)

**3. Information Asymmetry**
- Tenure committees can't evaluate 100 journals deeply
- Use proxies: impact factor, journal name recognition
- Changing this requires new credentialing infrastructure
- Timeline: 15+ years

**4. Publisher Adaptation**
- High margins = resources to invest, acquire, evolve
- Faster adaptation than startups + regulatory pressure
- Can offer carrot (prestige) and stick (reject papers)
- Timeline: Continuous adaptation

### Historical Precedent: Print→Digital (1990-2005)

**What Happened**:
- First e-journals: 1994-95
- Widespread adoption: ~2005 (10 years)
- **Publishers thrived**: Elsevier, Springer, Wiley all adapted successfully
- Revenue models evolved (site licenses, bundles)
- Incumbents acquired upstarts (Elsevier bought SSRN, Mendeley)

**Lessons**:
- Technology enabling change ≠ fast adoption
- Incumbents with capital can adapt
- Institutional purchasing decisions are sticky
- 10-15 year timelines are realistic

**Projection**: Current changes follow similar pattern. Expect meaningful shifts by 2035-2040, not 2028-2030.

---

## Part IV: Realistic Projections (2025-2035)

### What Will Happen:

**By 2030:**
- OA reaches 60-65% (up from 46%, but not universal)
- PDF remains dominant format (>90% of papers)
- Jupyter notebooks: 5-10% in computational fields, <2% overall
- Elsevier, Springer Nature remain top 2 publishers
- Hybrid business models (subscription + APC) dominant
- AI discovery tools standard (offered by publishers)
- Retraction rates continue rising
- Chinese publishing ecosystem fully mature

**By 2035:**
- OA reaches 70-75% (gradual continuation)
- Executable formats: 15-20% in computational sciences, 5% overall
- Preprint-first normalized in some fields (physics, biology), not universal
- Tenure criteria starting to shift (quality over quantity)
- Publisher consolidation continues (top 5 control 70%+ market)
- Nanopublications and structured data: 10-15% adoption
- Diamond OA: ~35,000 journals (modest growth, sustainability issues persist)

### What Won't Happen (By 2035):

❌ Universal OA (still ~25-30% paywalled)
❌ PDF replacement (still 70%+ of papers)
❌ Diamond OA replacing subscriptions (niche model)
❌ Publisher disruption (top publishers adapt, consolidate)
❌ Prestige hierarchy collapse (Nature/Science still elite)
❌ Tenure criteria transformation (slow partial reform only)
❌ Peer review replacement (still dominant credentialing)

### Why These Projections Are Conservative:

Historical precedent (print→digital) + incumbent adaptation + incentive misalignment + institutional inertia = slow change.

Optimistic projections assume:
- Technology adoption = technology availability (FALSE)
- Policy compliance = policy announcement (FALSE)
- Moral arguments change behavior (FALSE)
- Upstarts disrupt incumbents (RARE in academic publishing)

Realistic projections use:
- Historical timelines (10-15 years for major shifts)
- Actual compliance rates (not aspirational ones)
- Economic incentives (prestige-seeking, profit-maximizing)
- Incumbent resources (30%+ margins enable adaptation)

---

## Part V: Who Wins, Who Loses

### Winners:

**1. Incumbent Publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley)**
- High margins fund adaptation
- Acquire upstarts and threats
- Vertical integration (publishing + tools + data)
- Network effects and prestige protect position
- Consolidation increases market power

**2. Elite Universities**
- Nature/Science publications maintain rankings advantage
- Can afford transformative agreements
- Faculty prestige reinforces institutional prestige
- Attract best students/faculty via reputation

**3. AI Tool Providers**
- Growing market for discovery, summarization, synthesis
- Publishers either build or acquire these
- Potential: Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, specialized startups

**4. China**
- Building parallel ecosystem
- Reducing Western dependence
- Domestic journals rising in prestige
- Government support for R&D and publishing

### Losers:

**1. Mid-Tier Publishers**
- Can't compete on prestige with elite journals
- Can't compete on price with diamond OA
- Get squeezed or acquired
- Examples: Some society publishers, regional journals

**2. Developing World Researchers**
- Can't afford APCs ($5,000+)
- Excluded from prestige hierarchy
- Diamond OA struggles with sustainability
- Stuck in "publish in Western journals vs. publish locally" dilemma

**3. Diamond OA Advocates**
- Sustainability crisis
- 75% financially constrained
- Volunteer labor doesn't scale
- Grant funding temporary
- Closures increasing

**4. Early-Career Researchers**
- Prestige hierarchy entrenching (harder to break into Nature/Science)
- "Chaperoned" advantage for connected researchers
- Pressure to publish quantity over quality
- Precarious positions require playing prestige game

### Uncertain / Could Go Either Way:

**Preprint Servers (bioRxiv, arXiv)**
- Growing usage, but publishers adapting (overlay journals)
- Could get acquired by publishers
- Could become infrastructure (like GitHub)
- Outcome depends on credentialing evolution

**University Libraries**
- Cost pressures from rising APCs + subscriptions
- "Big Deals" hard to cancel (faculty backlash)
- Could organize collective action (hasn't happened yet)
- May get budget increases or forced cancellations

**Peer Review**
- Breaking under volume
- No scalable alternative proven
- AI-assisted review emerging but unproven
- Post-publication review experiments haven't scaled

---

## Part VI: What Would Actually Disrupt Publishing?

### Not Sufficient:
- Open access mandates (exist, partial compliance)
- Better technology (Jupyter exists, not adopted)
- Cheaper alternatives (diamond OA exists, sustainability crisis)
- Moral arguments (ignored if incentives misaligned)

### Potentially Sufficient:

**1. Universities Coordinate on Tenure Reform**
- Collective agreement to de-emphasize journal prestige
- Evaluate quality of work, not journal name
- **Problem**: Collective action is hard, free-rider incentives
- **Precedent**: DORA (San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment) signed by many, implemented by few
- **Likelihood**: Low in next 10 years

**2. Major Funders Enforce OA + Withhold Grant Money**
- Go beyond mandates to actual enforcement
- Reject grant proposals from non-compliant researchers
- **Problem**: Politically difficult, researcher backlash
- **Precedent**: Gates Foundation stopped APCs (but doesn't enforce compliance yet)
- **Likelihood**: Moderate over 10-15 years

**3. Google/Microsoft Build Better Discovery + Credentialing**
- Combine search + AI tools + reputation systems
- Bypass traditional journals for credentialing
- **Problem**: Universities still control hiring/tenure
- **Precedent**: Google Scholar didn't disrupt journals, complemented them
- **Likelihood**: Moderate, but likely to strengthen incumbents who integrate

**4. Generational Shift**
- Researchers who grew up with preprints, OA, AI tools
- Different norms and expectations
- Value speed over prestige
- **Problem**: Takes 20-30 years for generational turnover
- **Precedent**: Every generational shift is slow
- **Likelihood**: High eventually, but 2040s not 2030s

**5. Financial Crisis Forces Library Cancellations**
- Budget cuts make "Big Deals" unsustainable
- Coordinated cancellations (hard to organize)
- Force publishers to lower prices or lose revenue
- **Problem**: Requires coordination, publishers can divide and conquer
- **Precedent**: Some universities left Elsevier, most stayed
- **Likelihood**: Moderate if economic recession hits education

### Most Likely Scenario:

**Gradual evolution through combination of**:
- Slow OA growth (mandates + some enforcement)
- Incumbent adaptation (hybrid models, AI tools, vertical integration)
- Generational shift (younger researchers more OA-friendly)
- Selective disruption (some fields like physics/biology shift faster)
- Publisher consolidation (top publishers strengthen, mid-tier struggles)

**NOT**: Disruption
**RATHER**: Managed transition over 15-20 years with incumbents adapting

---

## Part VII: Recommendations—Revised

### For Publishers:

**1. Invest in AI Discovery Infrastructure (Now)**
- Value is shifting from access to navigation
- Build tools researchers can't get elsewhere
- Vertical integration: publishing + discovery + collaboration
- **Examples**: Elsevier's Scopus, Springer's Nature Index + better AI

**2. Adopt New Formats When Demand Exists (Not Before)**
- Jupyter notebook infrastructure costs money
- Wait for researchers to demand it (field by field)
- Don't lead with technology—follow demonstrated demand
- **Timing**: Computational fields in 3-5 years, rest 10+ years

**3. Manage the OA Transition (Don't Resist)**
- Hybrid models buy time
- Shift revenue from subscriptions to APCs/services
- Increase APC prices as subscription revenue declines
- **But**: Manage public perception (avoid "double dipping" criticism)

**4. Acquire Threats Before They Scale**
- Preprint servers, AI tools, discovery platforms
- Cheaper to acquire than compete
- **Examples**: Elsevier buying Mendeley/SSRN, Springer could buy bioRxiv
- Vertical integration is the moat

**5. Leverage Prestige and Network Effects**
- Elite journals (Nature, Science, Cell) are extremely defensible
- Researchers need credentialing more than you need any single researcher
- Protect prestige through selective acceptance, high editorial standards
- **Reality**: Your product is status, not just information

### For Researchers:

**1. Recognize the Incentive Trap**
- Universities reward journal prestige
- Your career depends on playing the game
- Individual defection to OA/preprints is costly
- **Reality**: Change requires collective action or tenure reform

**2. Use AI Tools for Discovery, Not Replacement**
- AI summarization is useful for triage
- Deep reading still needed for important papers
- Verify AI-generated citations (hallucination risk)
- **Balance**: Efficiency + rigor

**3. Support Diamond OA and Preprints When You Can**
- Post preprints (usually allowed)
- Serve as editor/reviewer for diamond OA journals
- **But**: Don't sacrifice career for principle
- Wait for incentives to align

### For Universities:

**1. Reform Tenure Criteria (Slowly, Collectively)**
- Emphasize research quality over journal name
- Reduce dependence on impact factor
- **Problem**: Requires discipline-wide coordination
- **Approach**: Join coalitions (DORA, others), implement gradually

**2. Negotiate Collectively with Publishers**
- Consortia have more leverage than individual libraries
- Threaten coordinated cancellations
- **Reality**: Hard to organize, but possible

**3. Support Sustainable OA Infrastructure**
- Fund diamond OA journals long-term (not just 2-3 year grants)
- Invest in institutional repositories
- Build shared infrastructure (editorial platforms, peer review systems)

### For Funders:

**1. Enforce Mandates (Don't Just Announce)**
- Compliance checking in grant reports
- Consequences for non-compliance
- **Problem**: Researchers will push back
- **Approach**: Gradual escalation, help with costs

**2. Fund Sustainable Alternatives**
- Multi-year support for diamond OA (5-10 years, not 2-3)
- Shared infrastructure (repositories, peer review platforms)
- **Reality**: Short grants create sustainability crisis

---

## Conclusion: The Resilience of Incumbents

The initial analysis predicted disruption by 2030. The data shows something different: **gradual evolution by 2035-2040, with incumbent adaptation**.

**Why incumbents are resilient**:
- 30-37% profit margins fund adaptation
- Network effects and prestige create moats
- Institutional inertia slows change
- Researchers need credentialing, not just information
- Universities perpetuate prestige hierarchy
- High barriers to replacing editorial infrastructure

**Why disruption is unlikely**:
- Technology exists but adoption lags by 10-15 years
- Policy mandates have partial compliance
- Diamond OA struggles with sustainability
- Prestige hierarchy entrenched through rankings/tenure
- Collective action problems prevent coordination

**The real story**:
- More like print→digital (publishers adapted) than Napster→Spotify (industry disrupted)
- Change is happening: OA growing, formats evolving, AI tools emerging
- But timelines are longer and incumbents are stronger than hype suggests
- By 2035: majority OA, minority executable formats, top publishers still top

**For decision-makers**:
- Don't bet on rapid disruption
- Incumbents have resources and incentives to adapt
- Changes are real but gradual
- Plan for 15-year transition, not 5-year revolution

**The unsexy truth**: Evolution beats revolution. Adaptation beats disruption. Incumbents with 30%+ margins and institutional backing don't collapse—they evolve. That's what the data shows.

*"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it."* — Upton Sinclair

This analysis attempts to understand what's actually happening, not what we wish were happening. The data shows incumbent resilience, not imminent disruption. Planning should reflect that reality.
