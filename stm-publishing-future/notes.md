# Research Notes: STM Publishing Evolution (Revised Deep Investigation)

## Research Question
How will STM publishing evolve in the next few years given:
- Research volume growth vs viewership decline
- Evolution of file output formats
- Changes in research consumption patterns

## Timeline
Started: 2025-11-19
Revised: 2025-11-19 (after critical self-assessment)

## Investigation Log

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (ARCHIVED)
- Completed surface-level analysis based on web search
- Identified trends but lacked critical depth
- **ARCHIVED** in archive/v1_initial_analysis/

### Phase 2: Critical Self-Assessment
Identified major weaknesses in initial analysis:
1. Unverified viral statistics (attention span claims)
2. Technology determinism (assuming tech drives change)
3. Cherry-picked success stories (ignored failures)
4. Naive business model analysis (no financial data)
5. Western/English bias (ignored Chinese, other ecosystems)
6. Correlation→causation leaps
7. Missing stakeholder analysis
8. No historical context
9. Superficial volume analysis
10. Policy vs reality gap
11. No contrary evidence
12. Weak projection methodology

### Phase 3: Deep Investigation with Primary Sources

## KEY FINDINGS FROM DEEP RESEARCH

### 1. Publisher Economics: The Profit Reality

**Actual Costs vs. Charges:**
- Real cost per article: $200-$1,000 (varies by rejection rate, platform)
- Examples:
  - Hindawi: $290/article for 22,000 articles
  - Ubiquity Press: £200 (US$300)
  - JMLR: $6.50/paper
  - SciELO Brazilian journals: $200-600/article
- **BUT publishers charge**: $3,000-$5,000+ APCs

**Profit Margins:**
- Elsevier: **37%** operating profit margin
- Springer Nature: **28%** operating profit margin (2024)
- For comparison: Microsoft, Google, Coca-Cola are lower
- Springer Nature 2024: €1,847M revenue, €512M profit

**Cost Breakdown (EMBO Press 2023):**
- 55% office costs (editors' salaries, administration)
- 40% outsourced services and digital platforms
- Only ~5% unaccounted
- **Key insight**: ~60% is editorial/peer review/quality control
- Platform/hosting is NOT the major cost

**What This Means:**
- Publishers are PROFITABLE because they charge 3-5x actual costs
- High margins suggest defensible moat, not vulnerability
- "Disruption" needs to overcome editorial infrastructure, not just hosting

### 2. Open Access: Policy vs. Reality Gap

**Plan S Compliance:**
- Compliance varies wildly: 27-91% across funders (avg 67%)
- Voluntary OA policies: as low as 5% compliance
- Coalition S ended transformative deals Dec 2024, but...
- **Reality**: 46.2% of 2023 papers had "some form" of OA (Scopus)
- "Some form" includes green OA (repository), embargoed, etc.

**Key Gap:**
- Policy announcements ≠ implementation
- Compliance "plateaued in recent years" despite mandates
- Transformative agreements strengthened BIG publishers (Elsevier, Springer)
- ESAC Registry hit 1,000 agreements, but consolidated power

**What This Means:**
- NOT a revolution, more like gradual shift
- Incumbents adapting successfully
- 50% still NOT open access after years of mandates

### 3. Diamond OA: The Sustainability Crisis

**Financial Reality (2024 surveys):**
- 75% of African diamond OA journals cite financial constraints as biggest challenge
- 71.4% operate WITHOUT approved annual budget
- 40% describe funding as "unstable" or "very unstable"
- 45.2% struggle with lack of human resources
- 60% rely partially or entirely on volunteers
- 25% report financial LOSSES
- **23 German diamond OA journals CLOSED** (not just a Global South problem)

**Funding Challenges:**
- Most grants last 2-3 years only
- No proven sustainability model at scale
- Consortium funding = cost shifting to universities
- Volunteer labor doesn't scale to major journals

**What This Means:**
- Diamond OA struggling MORE than initial analysis suggested
- NOT a viable replacement for subscription model (yet)
- Gap between ideals and economic reality is large

### 4. Executable Notebooks: Tiny Actual Adoption

**GitHub Activity:**
- 1.5M GitHub repos with Jupyter Notebooks (+92% YoY)
- Sounds impressive, but...

**Actual Publishing:**
- Of 91 papers examined: only 37 provided accessible Jupyter notebooks
- Only 40% of papers mentioning notebooks actually shared them
- Journal of Open Source Software: 431 papers total (tiny)
- Systematic literature review: 146 publications on Jupyter (not IN Jupyter)

**What This Means:**
- Technology exists, adoption in PUBLISHING is <1%
- Gap between developer tools and publication formats remains huge
- SciPy, AGU "Notebooks Now!" are outliers, not trends
- **Reality check**: Executable papers are 5-10 years from mainstream

### 5. Researcher Incentives: NOT Changing

**Why researchers still chase Nature/Science:**
- Prestige/reputation: top-rated attribute in journal selection
- Career benefits: Nature/Science paper = jobs, funding, resources
- Institutional pressure: ARWU rankings give 20% weight to Nature/Science papers
- "Chaperoned" advantage: need existing Nature/Science authors to get in
- Getting HARDER to break in (new senior authors dropped from 39%→31%)

**Recent Survey (2024, ZSoA):**
- Academics under pressure focus on journal reputation and publication speed
- Quality and reputation remain most highly rated selection criteria
- NOT focusing on OA, format, or accessibility

**Tenure/Promotion:**
- Reform movement exists but implementation SLOW
- Citation counts and publication metrics still dominate
- "Public impact" research still disadvantaged
- Quantity over quality persists despite criticism

**What This Means:**
- Prestige hierarchy UNCHANGED
- Researchers have no incentive to switch to diamond OA/preprints
- Network effects protect incumbent high-impact journals
- Disruption requires changing university incentives, not just publishing tech

### 6. The Chinese Ecosystem I Ignored

**Size & Growth:**
- CNKI: world's largest Chinese-language academic repository
- 1,300 top-rated journals
- Chinese R&D: 2.6% of GDP, ~$470B in 2024
- Biggest 20 international publishers: 83% of Chinese-authored articles (2012-2021)

**Strategic Shift:**
- China reformed "SCI supremacy" model (reducing Western journal reliance)
- "China Science and Technology Journal Excellence Action Plan"
- Moving AWAY from Western publishing
- Investing abroad: Frontiers China, offices in London/Singapore

**What This Means:**
- My initial analysis had massive Western bias
- Chinese market is parallel ecosystem, not following Western trends
- Global publishing ≠ just US/European dynamics
- Projections ignoring China are incomplete

### 7. Retraction Crisis: Quality Control Collapse

**Volume:**
- 10,000+ retractions in 2023
- BUT 8,000 were from single publisher (Hindawi paper mills)
- Real retraction rate: ~0.2% (tripled in decade)
- European biomedical: 4x increase (2000-2020)

**Reproducibility:**
- 89% of cancer biology results couldn't be reproduced (Amgen)
- Only 39% of 100 psychology studies replicated
- >70% of researchers report failure to reproduce others' work
- 400,000+ published articles show paper mill similarities

**What This Means:**
- Volume growth IS straining quality control
- Peer review breaking under scale
- More papers ≠ more reliable science
- Crisis is real, not just perception

### 8. Attention Span Research: Validated BUT Misapplied

**Gloria Mark's Research:**
- 2004: 2.5 minutes average screen time before switching
- 2012: 75 seconds
- 2016: 47 seconds (median 40 seconds)
- Methodology: Direct observation + computer logging
- Replicated by others with similar results
- NO methodological critiques found in literature

**BUT My Overgeneralization:**
- This measures screen-switching in workplace/general use
- NOT deep reading of research papers specifically
- Doesn't prove scientists read papers less
- Could mean better filtering (reading fewer, more relevant papers)

**What This Means:**
- Attention fragmentation is real
- Application to scientific reading is ASSUMED, not proven
- Could be adaptation, not crisis

### 9. Historical Precedent: Slower Than Expected

**Print→Digital Transition (1990-2005):**
- First e-journals: 1994-95
- Took 10-15 years for widespread adoption
- Publishers ADAPTED successfully (didn't get disrupted)
- Elsevier, Springer, Wiley thrived through transition

**Key Lessons:**
- Incumbents with editorial infrastructure survived
- Technology availability ≠ rapid adoption
- Institutional inertia is powerful
- Revenue models evolved gradually

**What This Means:**
- Assuming 5-year transformation is naive
- 10-15 year timeline more realistic
- Incumbents likely to adapt again

## REVISED Understanding: What's Actually Happening

### The Things NOT Changing:
1. **Prestige hierarchy**: Nature/Science still dominate career outcomes
2. **University incentives**: Tenure/promotion still based on impact factor
3. **Researcher behavior**: Still chase high-impact journals
4. **Publisher profitability**: 30-37% margins suggest defensible business
5. **Peer review as bottleneck**: No scalable alternative proven
6. **Network effects**: Elite journals get better submissions → more citations → more prestige

### The Things Changing Slowly (10+ years):
1. **OA adoption**: 46%→70% by 2035 (not 2027)
2. **Format evolution**: PDF dominance for another decade
3. **Regional diversification**: Chinese/non-Western growth
4. **AI tools**: Filtering, not replacing reading

### The Things Failing:
1. **Diamond OA sustainability**: 75% financially constrained, closures increasing
2. **Preprint-first**: Hasn't replaced traditional publishing
3. **Quality control**: Retractions rising, reproducibility crisis

### The Real Story:

**NOT**: "Publishing revolution by 2030"
**ACTUALLY**: "Gradual evolution with incumbent adaptation"

Publishers with high margins can:
- Invest in AI discovery tools
- Adopt new formats when demand exists
- Acquire upstarts (Elsevier bought Mendeley, SSRN)
- Use network effects and prestige to maintain position

The "crisis" is real but manageable for publishers because:
- Researchers need credentialing more than publishers need any single researcher
- Universities perpetuate prestige hierarchy through promotion criteria
- Network effects create winner-take-all dynamics
- High margins fund adaptation

---

## What I Got Wrong Initially:

1. **Overestimated disruption speed**: Technology exists ≠ adoption happens
2. **Underestimated incumbent adaptation**: High margins = resources to adapt
3. **Ignored incentive alignment**: Publishers/universities both benefit from status quo
4. **Cherry-picked evidence**: Highlighted successes, ignored failures
5. **Missed geography**: Focused on 50% of market (Western), ignored rest
6. **Confused correlation and causation**: AI adoption ≠ reading decline proven
7. **Policy ≠ reality**: Mandates announced ≠ compliance achieved

## What To Investigate Next:

1. ✓ Real mechanisms of change (incentives, not just technology)
2. ✓ Who wins/loses in different scenarios
3. ✓ Actual adoption timelines based on historical precedent
4. ✓ Publisher strategic responses (acquisition, vertical integration)
5. ✓ The unbundling hypothesis (dissemination vs. certification vs. discovery)
