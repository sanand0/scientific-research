## Key Findings

### Historical Tariff War Regimes

#### 1. Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930s)
- Signed June 17, 1930, raising tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods
- World trade declined by 66% between 1929 and 1934
- U.S. imports from Europe: $1,334M (1929) → $390M (1932) - 71% decline
- U.S. exports to Europe: $2,341M (1929) → $784M (1932) - 67% decline
- 35 governments lodged protests; extensive retaliation followed
- U.S. exports to retaliating nations fell by 28-32%
- Quantitative estimates: reduced real output by up to 2%, lowered U.S. TFP by 0.5%
- Led to fundamental policy shift toward trade liberalization (1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act)

#### 2. US-China Trade War (2018-2020)
- Launched 2018, tariffs on $350B+ Chinese imports by late 2019
- China retaliated on $100B of US exports
- China's share of U.S. imports: 22% (2017) → 14% (2023)
- Supply chain restructuring: 244 discrete relocation decisions by 141 manufacturers (2018-2023)
  - 66.4% adopted "China-plus-many" strategies
  - Vietnam: single largest beneficiary (75 of 244 moves)
- Trade elasticity quadrupled over 4 years (showing slow adjustment to policy changes)
- Prices of US intermediate goods rose 10-30%
- Costs passed to consumers; spillover effects through production networks
- Key difference from 1930s: resulted in supply chain diversification, not trade collapse

### Evolution of Global Ecommerce (2020-2025)

## Analysis: Key Differences Between Historical and Modern Tariff Regimes

### 1. Speed and Granularity of Trade
**Historical (1930s):**
- Trade conducted through bulk shipments, multi-month timelines
- Limited product variety, standardized goods
- Physical catalogs, in-person negotiations

**Modern (2020s):**
- Individual consumer parcels: 1.36B de minimis shipments (2024) vs. 134M (2015)
- Real-time transactions, instantaneous global price comparison
- Algorithmic pricing, dynamic inventory management
- Mobile commerce: 73% of ecommerce by 2025

**Implication:** Tariff changes now affect billions of micro-transactions in real-time, not just bulk industrial trade.

### 2. Supply Chain Transparency and Flexibility
**Historical (1930s, even 2018):**
- Opaque supply chains, limited visibility
- Multi-year facility investments, slow reconfiguration
- Trade elasticity adjustment: years to decades

**Modern (2020s):**
- IoT sensors, blockchain, real-time tracking across entire supply chain
- AI-powered optimization: 2.7x faster tariff response
- "China-plus-many" strategies: 244 relocations by 141 manufacturers in 5 years
- 4-year trade elasticity 4x higher than 1-year (still slow, but accelerating)

**Implication:** Digital technologies enable faster supply chain reconfiguration, but friction remains significant.

### 3. Consumer Information and Expectations
**Historical (1930s):**
- Limited price transparency
- Regional market segmentation
- Weeks/months between tariff announcement and consumer awareness

**Modern (2020s):**
- 77% of consumers immediately aware of price increases
- 56.5% expect retailers to absorb tariff costs
- Social media amplifies tariff discussions
- Cart abandonment when tariffs added at checkout (Shopify addressing)

**Implication:** Consumer awareness and resistance create new political economy dynamics around tariff policy.

### 4. New Forms of Digital Protectionism
**Historical (1930s):**
- Only physical goods tariffs
- Clear national borders for trade enforcement

**Modern (2020s):**
- Physical goods tariffs + data localization requirements
- Digital services taxes (e.g., Canada DST 2024)
- "Digital sovereignty" justifications for blocking cross-border data flows
- Ambiguity: are data flows "trade"? Do WTO rules apply?

**Implication:** Tariff wars now intertwine with data governance, creating multi-dimensional trade conflicts.

### 5. Marketplace Platform Dynamics
**Historical:**
- Bilateral firm-to-firm or nation-to-nation trade
- Clear seller/buyer identities

**Modern:**
- 50% of Amazon U.S. third-party sales from Chinese sellers
- Temu, Shein: >30% of daily U.S. de minimis packages
- Platform responsibility: who pays tariffs? Seller? Platform? Consumer?
- Platforms can hide/reveal country-of-origin, affecting consumer behavior

**Implication:** Global platforms create jurisdictional ambiguity and shift tariff incidence in novel ways.

### 6. Retaliation Mechanisms
**Historical (1930s):**
- Symmetric retaliation: tariffs for tariffs
- 35 governments protested Smoot-Hawley
- Linear escalation

**Modern (2020s):**
- Asymmetric retaliation: tariffs + data localization + digital services taxes
- Postal service shutdowns (Swiss Post, Japan Post, etc.)
- Platform bans (TikTok discussions)
- Cyber operations (unconfirmed but speculated)

**Implication:** Retaliation now spans multiple domains, harder to negotiate/resolve.

### 7. Climate and Sustainability Pressures
**Historical (1930s):**
- No environmental considerations in trade policy
- Carbon-intensive shipping acceptable

**Modern (2020s):**
- Increasing weather-induced supply chain disruptions (Nature Sustainability 2024)
- Carbon border adjustment mechanisms emerging
- Tariffs potentially forcing longer, less efficient supply chains
- Environmental costs of reshoring vs. offshore production

**Implication:** Tariff decisions now must balance economic, geopolitical, AND environmental factors.

## Research Summary

Total research topics identified: **21 topics across 7 categories**

**High-priority topics** (based on data availability, policy relevance, and theoretical novelty):
1. Tariff Incidence in Multi-Sided Platforms (1.1) - natural experiment from de minimis elimination
2. Optimal De Minimis Threshold Design (3.3) - immediate policy relevance
3. Multi-Domain Retaliation in Modern Trade Wars (5.1) - theoretically novel, observable in real-time
4. Real-Time Tariff Impact Monitoring (7.1) - methodological innovation with immediate applications
5. AI-Enabled Tariff-Responsive Supply Chain Optimization (2.1) - causal identification possible

**Key insight:** The convergence of tariffs and ecommerce creates fundamentally new research questions that couldn't exist in the pre-digital era. Traditional trade economics must be reimagined for:
- Micro-transaction scale (billions of parcels)
- Platform intermediation (jurisdictional ambiguity)
- Real-time price adjustment (algorithmic markets)
- Multi-domain policy instruments (tariffs + data + infrastructure)
- Consumer political engagement (high awareness, immediate feedback)

The 2024-2025 tariff regime changes (especially de minimis elimination) create natural experiments for causal inference that won't be available again for decades.
