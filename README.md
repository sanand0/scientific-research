# Scientific Research

- [Dye Discovery Acceleration](dye-discovery-acceleration/) - Computational pipeline for accelerating chemical dye discovery with optimized color, light fastness, and washing fastness - identified 3 novel anthraquinone derivatives and reduced R&D cycle time by 70-80%
- [Tariff eCommerce Research](tariff-ecommerce-research/) - Identified 29 research topics (expanded from 21) across 8 categories at the intersection of historical tariff wars and modern global ecommerce. Includes consumer nationalism as alternative to tariffs, leveraging natural experiments from 2024-2025 de minimis elimination and cross-country "buy local" campaigns.
- [Frontiers Business Strategy](frontiers-business-strategy/) - Frontiers Publishing strategic analysis: 14.6% neuroscience share, 0.54% AI/ML share, $468M annual opportunity in convergence fields (AI×Bio, Climate×Health)
- [The Resilient Incumbents](stm-publishing-future/): Deep investigation revealing that STM publishing won't transform as fast as hyped—publishers post 30-37% margins, OA compliance plateaued at 46%, diamond OA faces sustainability crisis (75% financially constrained), executable notebooks <1% adoption. Realistic timeline: gradual evolution over 15 years with incumbent adaptation, not 5-year disruption. Analysis includes critical self-assessment correcting initial Western bias, technology determinism, and cherry-picked evidence.
- [Article Metadata Extraction](article-metadata-extraction/) - Optimal workflows for extracting citations, abstracts, and author metadata from scientific PDFs with minimal human involvement using PyMuPDF + GPT-4 hybrid approach
- [Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers](clarivate-highly-cited-researchers/) - Investigative analysis of 6,868 elite scientists reveals extreme concentration: 3 countries claim 65% of researchers, top 10 institutions hold 25%, and 44% work cross-field—challenging assumptions about merit, access, and the geography of genius
- [Publication Trends Analysis](publication-trends-analysis/) - Frontiers showed slowest adoption of emerging fields (0.54% AI, 0.01% climate) vs MDPI (37.39% annual growth) and PLOS (+16% YoY); AI/ML preprints grow 2x faster than peer-review (arXiv doubling every 23 months) due to field velocity and competitive dynamics, while clinical medicine maintains peer-review primacy for regulatory/safety reasons
