### STM Publishing Future Analysis (Revised)
**The Resilient Incumbents**: Deep investigation revealing that STM publishing won't transform as fast as hyped—publishers post 30-37% margins, OA compliance plateaued at 46%, diamond OA faces sustainability crisis (75% financially constrained), executable notebooks <1% adoption. Realistic timeline: gradual evolution over 15 years with incumbent adaptation, not 5-year disruption. Analysis includes critical self-assessment correcting initial Western bias, technology determinism, and cherry-picked evidence.
